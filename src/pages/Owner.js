      <p>
        MA LICHMA DEVI LIBRARY was founded in honor of my beloved mother. As the owner,
        my mission is to provide a peaceful, welcoming place where every student can study,
        grow and succeed.

      <p>
        I believe knowledge is for everyone â€” this library is my humble contribution
        to help students and readers in our community.
